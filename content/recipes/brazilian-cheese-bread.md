*(makes 16-24 mini-rolls)*

* 1 egg
* 1/3 cup olive oil
* 2/3 cup milk
* 1 1/2 cup tapioca flour (loosely packed, 170 grams)
* 1/2 cup grated cheese (packed, 66 grams), preferably queso fresco
* 1 tsp salt
* other spices to taste (thyme, rosemary, etc.)

Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Grease a mini-muffin tin. Add all ingredients to
blender and pulse until smooth, using a spatula to scrape down the sides as
necessary. Bake for 15-20 minutes, until puffy and just lightly browned. Batter
can be saved in the refrigerator for up to a week.
