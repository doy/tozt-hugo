title: paneer masala
---

* 2-3 large onions
* 1 inch piece of ginger
* 8 cloves garlic
* 1-3 green chilis
* 3 tbsp vegetable oil
* 1/4 tsp turmeric powder
* 1 1/2 tsp coriander powder (optional)
* 1 tsp cumin powder (1 1/2 tsp if not using coriander powder)
* 1 can tomato sauce
* salt
* coriander leaves
* garam masala
* 1 block (~1/2 lb) paneer (can also use channa, cauliflower, potatoes, etc)

Chop onions, garlic, ginger, and chilis. Fry onions in oil, adding garlic,
ginger, and chilis when browning (about 10 minutes). Add turmeric, coriander,
and cumin. Fry another 30 seconds or so, then add tomato sauce. Fry a bit
longer, then add salt to taste. Add coriander leaves, continue frying. Blend if
desired once it cools. (Can be stored after this step.)

Before serving, add water as desired. Bring to a boil, and add paneer. Cook for
a few minutes, then sprinkle garam masala and coriander leaves on top, and
serve.
