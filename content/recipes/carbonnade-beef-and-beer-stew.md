title: carbonnade beef and beer stew
---

* 3.5 lb chuck roast, cut into 1 inch pieces
* salt and black pepper
* 4 tbsp butter
* 8 cups sliced yellow onions (about three medium onions)
* 3 tbsp flour
* 1.5 cup chicken or beef broth
* 1 12 oz bottle of belgian beer
* 4 sprigs fresh thyme
* 2 bay leaves
* 1 tbsp whole grain mustard
* 1 tbsp brown sugar

Pat beef dry with paper towels, then season well with salt and pepper. On the
stove top, heat 2 tbsp butter in a large heavy bottomed dutch oven over medium
high heat until hot, almost smoking. Brown the meat in batches, without
stirring, for about three minutes on each side, then transfer the beef to a
separate bowl.

Add two tbsp of butter to the dutch oven and reduce heat to medium. Add the
onions and 0.5 tsp salt, and cook until the onions are browned. Add the flour
and stir until the onions are evenly coated and the flour is lightly browned.
Stir in the broth, scraping the pan bottom, and then stir in the beer, thyme,
bay leaves, salt, pepper, and beef (with juices). Increase heat to medium-high
and bring to a full simmer. Reduce heat to low, partially cover, and let cook
for 2-3 hours. Add mustard and brown sugar after around two hours.

Once cooked, remove the thyme and bay leaves. Adjust seasonings to taste.
