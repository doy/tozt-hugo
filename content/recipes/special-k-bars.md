title: special k bars
---

* 5 cups Special-K cereal
* 1 cup corn syrup
* 1 cup peanut butter
* 1 cup sugar
* 1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips
* 1 cup butterscotch chips

Melt the chocolate and butterscotch chips on a double boiler, stirring
regularly. While it's melting, heat the corn syrup, sugar, and peanut butter in
another pot until it just starts to caramelize.

Put the Special-K in a very large mixing bowl, and add the corn syrup and
peanut butter mix. Stir until the cereal is completely coated. Press this
mixture into a 9x13 pan (pressing it into the pan is easiest using your fingers
covered by a plastic bag).

Once the chocolate chips are melted, cover the bars with the melted chocolate,
making sure to cover the whole thing evenly. Let sit for a few hours until it
hardens, and serve.
