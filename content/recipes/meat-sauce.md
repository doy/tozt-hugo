title: meat sauce
---

* 1 lb ground beef
* 1 large onion, chopped
* 2 cloves garlic, chopped
* 2.5 cups chunky tomato sauce
* 1 tsp sugar
* 1 tsp italian seasoning
* .5 tsp thyme
* .5 tsp basil (3 chopped leaves)
* 1 tbsp parsley
* salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes to taste

Cook the onion in oil in a very large skillet, with the italian seasoning and
red pepper flakes, until the onions are softened. Add the garlic, thyme, salt,
and pepper. Cook for another minute, and remove from heat.

Generously salt the bottom of a large cast-iron pan, turn the stove to high,
and add the ground beef in chunks, without stirring. Make sure the meat is
browning well - turn down the heat if it starts to burn, but don't stir it.
Once it is browned on one side, flip it over to brown on the other side. Remove
the pan from the heat, but leave the meat in to finish cooking.

Move the cooked meat to the pan with the onions, and add the tomato sauce.
Break up the meat into small pieces, and add the basil and sugar. Simmer
uncovered on low heat for 15 minutes.

Once it is done cooking, adjust seasonings - add salt, pepper, sugar, or tomato
sauce as needed. Sprinkle with chopped parsley.
