title: fried goat cheese
---

* 1 lb goat cheese
* 1 cup panko bread crumbs
* 2 tsp dried parsley
* 1 tsp dried thyme
* .5 tsp powdered garlic
* .5 tsp ground white pepper
* pinch of salt
* 2 eggs, beaten
* .5 cup flour
* oil for deep frying
* honey

Combine bread crumbs, parsley, thyme, garlic, pepper, and salt in a bowl, and
mix well. Beat the eggs in a separate bowl, and put the flour in a third bowl.

Fill a deep fryer of some sort with oil, and heat it up. Roll the cheese into
balls, and then with each ball, coat it with flour, dip it in the eggs, and
cover it with bread crumbs. Make sure it's entirely covered with eggs, because
if the hot oil gets through the coating into the cheese, the oil will start
bubbling quite heavily. Drop the cheese ball into the oil, and let it fry for
2-3 minutes. Drizzle with honey and serve on bread.
