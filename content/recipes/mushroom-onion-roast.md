title: mushroom onion roast
---

* 1 roast (2 lbs)
* 1 can cream of mushroom soup (including the water if it's condensed soup)
* 1 packet onion soup mix
* .5 lbs boiler onions, peeled
* 1.5 lbs baby potatoes
* .5 lbs mushrooms
* 4 carrots
* 2 celery stalks
* 4 cloves garlic, chopped
* salt, pepper, rosemary, thyme to taste (a pretty decent amount)

Chop up the carrots and celery. Dump everything except the roast into the crock
pot, and mix well, making sure everything is coated. Turn up the heat, and add
the roast, making sure to cover it with the rest of the stuff in there. Cook
for 4 hours on high (or 8 hours on low). Turn the roast over halfway through
cooking to ensure that the part sticking out of the liquid doesn't dry out.
