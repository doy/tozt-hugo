title: blueberry lemon pie
---

*(makes one 9 inch pie)*

## Crust:

* 2.5 cups flour
* 1 tsp salt
* 2 tbsp sugar
* 1 cup unsalted butter, cut into 1 inch pieces
* .25-.5 cups ice water

## Filling:

* 4 cups (570g) blueberries
* .5 cups sugar
* 4 tbsp corn starch
* 2 tbsp lemon juice (these two are just one medium lemon)
* 1 tbsp lemon zest

## Egg wash:

* 1 large egg yolk
* 1 tbsp cream

Combine flour, salt, and sugar in a food processor and mix, then add the butter
and mix until it resembles a coarse meal (about 15 seconds in the processor).
Slowly add 1/4 cup of ice water, until the dough just holds together when
pinched (add up to another 1/4 cup of ice water if necessary). Split the dough
into two balls, flatten them into discs, cover with plastic wrap, and
refrigerate for an hour.

Remove one portion of the dough from the fridge, and place it on a lightly
floured surface. Roll it into a 12 inch circle, and transfer to a 9 inch pie
pan. Brush off any excess flour, and tuck the overhanging pastry under itself,
crimping as desired. Cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, remove the other portion of the dough, and roll it also into a 12
inch circle. Cut into 1 inch strips, place on a cookie sheet, cover with
plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 30 minutes.

Mix the sugar, corn starch, lemon juice, and lemon zest. Place the blueberries
in a large bowl, removing any soft or crushed ones. Add the sugar mixture to
the blueberries, and toss to combine. Pour the mixture into the pie shell.

In a small bowl, whisk together the egg yolk and cream. Lightly brush the outer
rim of the crust. Weave the remaining strips of dough onto the top of the pie,
and brush them with the egg wash as well, making sure it doesn't pool.
Refrigerate for another 30 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees, and place the oven rack in the lower third of
the oven. Place the pie on a larger baking pan to catch spills, and bake for
about 20 minutes, then lower the temperature to 350 and bake for another 35-45
minutes, or until the crust turns deep golden brown and the juices are
bubbling. If the crust edges are browning too quickly, cover them with foil.

After removing the pie from the oven, let it sit for several hours to allow the
juices to thicken, and serve at room temperature with whipped cream or ice
cream.
