title: corn fritters
---

*(makes about 16 fritters)*

* 1 cup flour
* .25 tsp baking powder
* .5 tsp salt
* 1 tsp ground coriander
* .5 tsp ground cumin
* 1 egg, lightly beaten
* 1 tsp lemon juice
* .5 cup water
* 2 cups corn kernels
* .5 cup scallions or green onions, finely sliced (about 4)
* .25 cup chopped cilantro
* canola oil

Sift together the flour, baking powder, salt, ground coriander, and ground
cumin in a medium bowl. Add the egg, lemon juice, and water. Stir vigorously
until smooth. Add the corn, onions, and cilantro. Stir until just combined.

Heat large frying pan on medium high heat. Add enough oil to generously coat
the bottom of the pan. Once oil is hot, spoon about two heaping tablespoons of
fritter batter into the pan per fritter, patting them down with the back of the
spoon and leaving about .5 inches between them. Cook about 2-3 minutes on each
side, or until browned.
