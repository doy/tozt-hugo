title: enchilada sauce
---

* 3 tbsp olive oil
* 3 tbsp flour
* 1 tbsp chili powder
* 1 tsp cumin
* 1/2 tsp garlic powder
* 1/4 tsp oregano
* 1/4 tsp salt
* pinch of cinnamon
* 2 tbsp tomato paste
* 2 cups broth
* 1 tsp vinegar (apple cider or white)
* black pepper to taste

Combine the dry spices (except the pepper) in a bowl, and measure out the
tomato paste and broth. Heat the oil on medium heat until the flour sizzles on
contact. Add the flour to the oil and brown slightly for a few seconds while
whisking. Add the spices and continue browning while whisking continuously
(less than a minute - it will burn very easily).

Stir in the tomato paste, then the broth. Continue stirring to remove lumps,
and turn the heat up to medium high until it starts simmering, then bring the
heat down to just maintain the simmer. Simmer for 5-7 minutes until it thickens
slightly.

Remove from heat, and stir in the vinegar and pepper. Adjust spices further as
desired.
