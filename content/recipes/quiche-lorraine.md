title: quiche lorraine
---

* 1 pie crust (either pre-frozen or made fresh and frozen for 30 minutes)
* .5 lb bacon (or to taste)
* 1 cup milk
* .5 cup heavy cream
* 3 eggs
* .5 tsp salt
* black pepper to taste
* .125 tsp ground nutmeg
* 1 cup grated gruyere or cheddar cheese
* 1 heaping tbsp chopped chives

Preheat oven to 350F. Line the frozen crust with heavy duty aluminum foil or
parchment paper, allowing for a couple inches to extend beyond the sides of the
pie pan. Fill 2/3 full with dry beans or other pie weights. Bake for 20
minutes, then remove the pie weights and the foil. Poke holes in the base of
the crust with a fork. Return to the oven and bake for another 10 minutes,
until lightly browned all over. Remove from oven and set aside.

Cook the bacon, and chop into .25-.5 inch pieces.

Whisk the eggs in a large bowl. Add the nutmeg, salt, black pepper, and chives
and whisk a little more. Add the milk and cream, and whisk vigorously to
incorporate air into the mix. Arrange the bacon and cheese in the bottom of the
pie crust, whisk the egg mixture again, and then pour it gently on top of the
bacon and cheese.

Put the quiche into the preheated oven, and bake for 30-40 minutes. Check on it
after 30 minutes by jiggling the quiche - it should still move slightly when
you take it out.
