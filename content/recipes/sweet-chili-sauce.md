title: sweet chili sauce
---

* .75 cup rice vinegar
* .5 cup sugar
* 1.5 tsp red chili pepper flakes
* 1.5 tsp salt
* 1 clove garlic, minced

Combine all ingredients into a small saucepan. Cook on medium heat, stirring
until sugar dissolves. Increase heat to medium high, and let it boil for 5-10
minutes until the mixture becomes syrupy. Remove from the heat and let it cool
and continue to thicken. If it becomes too thick, you can add a small amount of
water to thin it back out.
