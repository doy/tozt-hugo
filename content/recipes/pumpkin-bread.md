title: pumpkin bread
---

*(makes 3 8-in loafs)*

* 3.5 cups flour
* 3 cups sugar
* 4 eggs
* 2 tsp baking soda
* 3 tsp nutmeg
* 3 tsp cinnamon
* .5 tsp ginger
* 1.5 tsp salt
* .25 cup oil
* .67 cup water
* 1 (15oz) can pumpkin

Mix flour, sugar, baking soda, nutmeg, cinnamon, ginger, and salt in a big
mixing bowl, until reasonably even. Mix eggs, oil, and water in a small bowl,
and then add to the mixing bowl. Add the pumpkin, and stir until all the lumps
are gone. Pour into three bread tins (or 5, if you use the small ones), and
bake at 350 for about an hour (until poking a toothpick in doesn't leave behind
any liquid).
