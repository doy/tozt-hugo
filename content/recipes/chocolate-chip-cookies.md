title: chocolate chip cookies
---

*(makes 15-18 cookies)*

* 2 cups flour
* .5 tsp baking soda
* .5 tsp salt
* .75 cups unsalted butter, melted
* 1 cup packed brown sugar
* .5 cups white sugar
* 1 tbsp vanilla extract
* 1 egg
* 1 egg yolk
* 2 cups semisweet chocolate chips

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Grease cookie sheets. In a medium-sized
bowl, sift together flour, baking soda, and salt. In another (larger) bowl,
cream together the butter, brown sugar, and white sugar until blended. Beat in
the vanilla, egg, and egg yolk until light and creamy. Mix in the dry
ingredients until just blended. Stir in the chocolate chips. Drop balls of
cookie dough onto the cookie sheets, using about .25 cups of dough for each
cookie. Bake for 15-17 minutes, until the edges start to turn brown.
