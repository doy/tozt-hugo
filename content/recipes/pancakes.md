*(makes ~8 pancakes)*

* 1 large egg
* 1 1/4 cup milk
* 1 tsp white vinegar
* 2 tbsp vegetable oil
* 1 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
* 1 tsp sugar
* 1 tsp baking powder
* 1/2 tsp baking soda
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1/4 tsp vanilla

Mix all ingredients together, and mix until smooth. Pour batter onto a
non-stick pan on medium. They're ready to flip once the edges start to harden.
