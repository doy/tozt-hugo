title: chicken nuggets
---

* .5 lb chicken
* .5 cup flour
* seasoning salt
* ginger
* thyme
* (other spices as desired)
* worcestershire sauce

Mix the flour and spices in a bowl (add enough spices so that you can start to
taste them if you dip your finger in the flour). Cut the chicken into bite
sized pieces, and roll the pieces in the flour. Repeat this 3-4 times, until
the flour no longer sticks to the chicken (as you finish coating the pieces
with flour, the moisture from inside the chicken will make the earlier pieces
sticky again).

Fry the chicken pieces in a pan with oil. As they are nearly cooked, add some
Worcestershire sauce to the pan, and stir to make sure it gets on all of them.
