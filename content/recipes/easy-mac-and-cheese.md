title: mac and cheese
---

*(serves 4)*

* 2 tbsp butter
* 2 tbsp flour
* 1 onion, diced
* 1 clove garlic, diced
* 2 cups (1/2 lb) cheddar cheese, grated
* 1 cup heavy cream
* 1/2 tsp nutmeg
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1/4 tsp pepper
* 1 box medium shell pasta

Start boiling the pasta (no, really). While it's cooking, saute the onions and
garlic. Add the flour, stir for 2 minutes, until well combined. Add cream,
nutmeg, salt, and pepper, bring to a boil. Add the cheese, combine. Drain the
pasta, add it to the cheese, stir until coated.
