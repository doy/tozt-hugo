title: italian sausage and mushroom risotto
---

* 2 tbsp olive oil
* 1 lb italian sweet sausage, removed from casings, crumbled
* 0.5 lb portobello mushrooms, stemmed, dark gills scraped out, caps diced
* 10 oz fresh shiitake mushrooms, stemmed, diced
* 1 tsp chopped fresh oregano
* 1 tsp chopped fresh thyme
* 1.5 cups Madeira
* 6 cups chicken stock
* 0.5 cups butter
* 1 large onion, chopped
* 4 garlic cloves, minced
* 2 cups arborio rice
* 0.5 cups asiago or parmesan cheese

Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Sprinkle a little salt
on the pan to prevent sticking. Add the sausage. Allow to brown on one side
before stirring it to cook the other side. Add the mushrooms, thyme, and
oregano, and cook until the mushrooms are tender (about 10 minutes). Add 0.5
cups of the Madeira, and scrape to deglaze the pan (about 1 minute). Set this
aside.

Heat the chicken stock in a large saucepan until it is steamy or simmering, and
keep warm over low heat. Melt butter in another large saucepan over medium-high
heat. Add onion and garlic and cook until the onion is translucent (about 5
minutes). Add the rice and stir for two minutes. Add the rest of the Madeira.
Cook, stirring constantly(!) until the Madeira has been absorbed (about 2
minutes). Ladle enough of the chicken stock to just cover the rice, simmer
until almost absorbed (about three minutes), and repeat until the rice is
tender but firm (about 20-25 minutes).

Stir in the sausage mixture, and season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer
to serving bowl and sprinkle with cheese.
