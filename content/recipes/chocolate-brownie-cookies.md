title: chocolate brownie cookies
---

*(makes 26 cookies without chips, 30 cookies with chips)*

* 8 oz bittersweet chocolate
* 3 tbsp butter
* 1 cup sugar
* 3 large eggs
* 1 tsp espresso powder
* 1 tsp vanilla
* 1 cup flour
* 1/4 tsp baking powder
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 1 cup chocolate chips (optional)

In a double boiler, or in the microwave, gently melt together the chocolate and
butter. To avoid heating the chocolate too much and possibly burning it, the
best method is to heat till the butter is melted and the chocolate has
partially melted, then remove from the heat. Stir till all the chocolate melts.

In a separate bowl, beat together the sugar and eggs till they're thoroughly
combined. You don't need a mixer, just do it in a medium sized bowl with a
wooden spoon. Add the hot melted chocolate, then stir in the remaining
ingredients, including the chocolate chips, if you're using them. Refrigerate
the batter like dough for 1 hour, to make it easier to handle.

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Lightly grease (or line with parchment) two
baking sheets, three if you have them.

Drop the cookie dough by the tablespoonfuls (about the size of a small ping
pong ball) onto the prepared baking sheets. A tablespoon cookie scoop makes
this task extremely simple. Leave about 2" between the dough balls, as they'll
spread as they bake.

Bake the cookies for 11 to 12 minutes, until their tops are shiny and cracked.
They won't crack until the very end, so keep a close eye on them; when they're
cracked all the way across the top surface, they're done. The point is, you
want these baked all the way through, but just barely; additional baking makes
them more crisp rather than chewy. Remove the cookies from the oven, and top
each with a kiss-shaped chocolate, a bittersweet chocolate wafer, or a
chocolate covered sunflower seed. Wait 5 minutes then transfer the cookies to a
wire rack to cool.
