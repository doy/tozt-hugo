title: ham and cheese casserole
---

*(serves 4-6)*

* 12 oz fusilli pasta
* 4 tbsp butter
* 2 cloves garlic
* 4 tbsp flour
* 2.5 cups milk
* 1/2 cup heavy cream
* 1/4 tsp ground nutmeg
* 1 tsp black pepper
* 1 tsp italian seasoning
* 3/4 tsp salt
* 1 cup parmesan cheese
* 1 cup mozzerella cheese
* 10 oz diced ham
* 1/4 cup fresh basil
* 1/4 cup chopped green onions

Preheat the oven to 400. Make the pasta, and save a cup of the pasta water for
later once it's done.

Make a roux with the flour, butter, and garlic on medium. Slowly add the milk
and cream while continuing to stir, and increase the heat to medium high. Add
the nutmeg, pepper, and italian seasoning. Add half of the cheese, and continue
stirring until melted. Add the salt and the water from earlier.

Combine the pasta and the sauce in a casserole dish, and add the ham, basil,
and green onions. Adjust seasoning to taste. Sprinkle the rest of the cheese on
top. Bake for 10-15 minutes.
