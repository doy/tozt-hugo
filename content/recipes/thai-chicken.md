title: thai chicken and mushrooms
---

* 2 chicken breasts
* 8oz mushrooms
* 1 package green onions
* 6 cloves garlic
* 2 inches ginger
* 1-2 tsp soy sauce
* 1 tbsp thai red curry paste
* 1 tbsp flour
* salt and pepper to taste
* sesame oil
* rice vinegar

Tenderize two chicken breasts and cut into strips. Mix salt, pepper, garlic
powder, and flour, and coat the chicken with it. Cook chicken on medium high
until browned on each side, without moving it (doesn't need to be cooked
entirely through).

Take chicken off and add garlic, ginger, mushrooms, soy sauce, and thai red
curry paste, and stir fry.

Add chicken back to the pan and glaze with rice vinegar. Add green onions and
sesame oil.
