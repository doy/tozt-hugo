* 1 cup rice
* 2 cups chicken broth
* 1 lime
* 1 small onion, finely chopped
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 1/3 cup cilantro, chopped
* salt to taste

Cook the onions with oil and salt for 3-4 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for
another minute, stirring so it doesn't burn.

Add onions, rice, and broth to the rice cooker. Add the juice and zest from the
lime, and cook the rice.

Once the rice is done, fluff in the cilantro.
