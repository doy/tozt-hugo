*(1 serving)*

* cooked white rice (preferably cold)
* 1 egg
* salt and pepper

Beat the egg, add salt and pepper to it. Add oil to the pan, cook the scrambled
eggs. Remove the eggs from the pan, add more oil, and add the rice. Stir-fry
for a few minutes, then stir in the soy sauce. Once the rice is hot, add the
eggs back in, along with whatever else is going in. Mix together and serve when
hot.
